# Project explanation

The project consists of a digital watch coded in C using finite state machines. The aim of this project was to get a closer look at digital systems coding, as well as the usage of hardware in a coding project. A compiled version of the project was run in a Raspberry Pi 3B+ that was connected to a Matrix Keyboard (1234567890ABCDEF) and an LCD display. The basic version of the project was meant to have a working watch that could change the time, but some features such as changing date, alarm, password, and turn on and off animations were added. 

For more information, you can check the report file in which all of the additional features are listed and explained. 
It was coded as part of the Digital Systems II course of 3rd year of Electrical and Computer Engineering at ETSIT-UPM.
